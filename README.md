# Cross-Cultural LLM Evaluation - Experimental Design

## Research Overview

This study employs structured autoethnographic methodology to systematically assess the cultural sensitivity of large language models (LLMs) across diverse cultural contexts. The research focuses on four cultures: China, United States, Germany, and Sweden, evaluating LLM performance across four functional dimensions: cultural concept understanding (TCU), emotional expression identification (EEI), social norm application (SNA), and value conflict coordination (VCC).

### Core Research Questions

- **RQ1**: How does cultural sensitivity in LLMs vary across different cultural backgrounds?
- **RQ2**: What impact do language conditions (English vs. native language) have on LLMs' cross-cultural understanding?
- **RQ3**: Are there consistent differences in sensitivity across various functional dimensions?
- **RQ4**: How can structured autoethnography help control subjective biases in evaluations?

## Experimental Framework

### Design Overview

**Experimental Design**: 4(cultures) × 3(models) × 4(functions) × 4(scenarios) × 2(complexities) × 2(languages) mixed design

**Cultural Backgrounds**: China, United States, Germany, Sweden - selected based on Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory

**Model Selection**: 
- GPT-4.1 (benchmark model)
- Claude-4-Sonnet (safety alignment)
- Gemini-2.5-Pro (multimodal)

**Functional Dimensions**: TCU, EEI, SNA, VCC

**Scenarios**: Business (BUS), Education (EDU), Social (SOC), Family (FAM)

**Complexity Levels**: Low (150-200 words), High (250-300 words)

**Language Conditions**: English vs. target culture's native language

### Cultural Selection Rationale

| Culture | Key Dimensions | Selection Rationale |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| **China** | High Collectivism + Long-term Orientation | Represents Eastern relational dynamics and hierarchical structures |
| **United States** | High Individualism + Short-term Orientation | Exemplifies Western directness and achievement orientation |
| **Germany** | Rule-oriented + Moderate Individualism | Represents structured, systematic cultural approaches |
| **Sweden** | Low Power Distance + Low Masculinity | Emphasizes equality, consensus, and well-being |

### Model Selection Rationale

| Model | Core Strengths | Selection Rationale |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| **GPT-4.1** | Broad training data | Serves as standard reference point |
| **Claude-4-Sonnet** | Strong value conflict handling | Represents safety-oriented AI development |
| **Gemini-2.5-Pro** | Multimodal capabilities | Provides architectural and philosophical contrast |

### Sample and Evaluation Design

**Sample Size**: 
- Base task types: 128
- Total interactions: 384 (128 × 3 models)
- Final sample: ~1,344 (including quality control)

**Evaluation Setup**: 
- Primary evaluator: 1 expert for main assessments
- Cultural validators: 3 experts (1 per culture)
- Validation sampling: 20% spot-checks
- Target reliability: ICC > 0.75

**Task Example** (Low-complexity TCU for Chinese culture):
*"Explain the concept of 'guanxi' (关系) in Chinese business culture, including its core meaning and how it differs from Western networking practices."*

### Implementation Timeline

- **Weeks 1-2**: Training and calibration
- **Weeks 3-8**: Main evaluation phase
- **Weeks 9-10**: Validation and quality control
- **Weeks 11-12**: Analysis and synthesis

### Statistical Analysis Plan

- **Primary Analysis**: Mixed ANOVA for main effects and interactions
- **Secondary Analysis**: Regression modeling and clustering techniques
- **Qualitative Analysis**: Thematic analysis of autoethnographic logs

## Expected Contributions

### Methodological Contributions
- First application of structured autoethnography to AI evaluation
