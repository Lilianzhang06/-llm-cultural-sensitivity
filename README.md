# Cross-Cultural Sensitivity Evaluation of Large Language Models - Experimental Design

## Project Overview

This is an empirical study grounded in structured autoethnographic methodology, aimed at systematically evaluating the cultural sensitivity of large language models (LLMs) in cross-cultural contexts. As LLMs gain widespread global adoption, their inherent cultural biases have emerged as a pressing concern. This research focuses on cultures from China, the United States, Germany, and Sweden, leveraging Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory to examine LLMs' performance across functional dimensions including cultural concept understanding (TCU), emotional expression identification (EEI), social norm application (SNA), and value conflict coordination (VCC).

**Research Background and Significance**: Existing LLM evaluations often suffer from fragmented theoretical validation, superficial methodological approaches, externalized cultural perspectives, and limited scale. This study innovatively incorporates structured autoethnography, emphasizing the evaluator's internal perspective and reflexive processes, to address these gaps and provide foundational guidance for developing more culturally inclusive AI systems.

**Core Research Questions**:
- **RQ1**: How do LLMs' cultural sensitivity performances differ across various cultural backgrounds?
- **RQ2**: How do language conditions (English vs. native language) influence LLMs' cross-cultural comprehension?
- **RQ3**: Are there systematic differences in cultural sensitivity across functional dimensions?
- **RQ4**: How does structured autoethnography mitigate subjective biases in cultural evaluations?

## Experimental Framework

### Design Overview
- **Mixed Experimental Design**: 4 (cultures) × 3 (models) × 4 (functions) × 4 (scenarios) × 2 (complexities) × 2 (languages).
- **Cultural Backgrounds**: China, United States, Germany, Sweden (selected based on Hofstede's dimensions to ensure diversity).
- **Model Types**: GPT-4.1 (benchmark), Claude-4-Sonnet (safety-aligned), Gemini-2.5-Pro (globalized).
- **Functional Dimensions**: TCU, EEI, SNA, VCC.
- **Scenarios**: Business (BUS), Education (EDU), Social (SOC), Family (FAM).
- **Complexity Levels**: Low (single concepts, 150-200 words); High (multi-faceted conflicts, 250-300 words).
- **Languages**: English vs. target native language.

**Cultural Selection Rationale (Summary Table)**:

| Culture | Key Dimensions | Selection Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| China | High Collectivism + Long-term Orientation | Represents Eastern relational cultures |
| United States | High Individualism + Short-term Orientation | Represents Western direct expression |
| Germany | Rule-oriented + Moderate Individualism | Emphasizes systematic thinking and procedural justice |
| Sweden | Low Power Distance + Low Masculinity | Highlights equality and quality of life priorities |

**Model Selection Rationale (Summary Table)**:

| Model | Core Strengths | Selection Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GPT-4.1 | Extensive training data | Industry baseline |
| Claude-4-Sonnet | Value conflict handling | Represents safety-focused AI paradigms |
| Gemini-2.5-Pro | Multimodal and globalized capabilities | Provides contrast in technical architecture |

### Sample and Evaluation
- **Sample Size**: 128 base task types × 3 models = 384 interactions, totaling approximately 1344 interactions (including quality controls).
- **Expert Configuration**: A single primary evaluator (with expertise in cross-cultural psychology) handles the main assessments, supported by three cultural validators (one per major culture) for 20% sampled validation, targeting ICC > 0.75.
- **Quality Controls**: Standardized protocols, self-calibration, structured reflexive logs, and intelligent sampling for validation.
- **Task Example** (Simplified): For a low-complexity TCU task in Chinese culture—analyze the concept of "guanxi" (关系), including core meanings and comparisons to Western networking.

### Implementation and Analysis
- **Timeline**: 12 weeks, encompassing training (Weeks 1-2), primary evaluation (Weeks 3-8), validation (Weeks 9-10), and analysis (Weeks 11-12).
- **Statistical Plan**: Mixed ANOVA, regression analysis, clustering; integrated with qualitative thematic analysis of autoethnographic data.
- **Risk Management**: Backup experts, API redundancies, and schedule buffers.

## Expected Contributions
- **Methodological**: First application of structured autoethnography to AI evaluation, offering a framework for bias control.
- **Theoretical**: Validation of LLM cultural bias mechanisms and construction of a four-dimensional evaluation model.
- **Practical**: Guidance for culturally adaptive AI product design, targeting journals such as IJHCS.
